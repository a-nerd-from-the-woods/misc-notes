# Practical Malware Analysis Essentials for Incident Responders (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xYpxe8mBg)

## Driving Questions
The Goal of malware analysis is to answer these questions:
* Does the file pose a threat to your organization?
* What capabilities does the file have?
* How can I detect this malware/file on other systems acress the organization?
* What does the file reveal about its creator/your adversary?
  * Malware is just a tool that is being used by someone else, there is always a human being behind it and, more importantly, a goal.

## Methods of Analysis
1. Fully-Automated Analysis (running file through virus scanner/analyzer)
2. Static properties analysis (manually analyzing file using [PeStudio](https://www.winitor.com/))
3. Interactive behavior analysis: (executing the file in a VM made to do so)
4. Manual code review: (reading the file line by line in a text editor)
