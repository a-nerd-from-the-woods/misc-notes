# Practical Malware Analysis Essentials for Incident Responders (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xYpxe8mBg)

## Inital Driving Questions
The Goal of malware analysis is to answer these questions:
* Does the file pose a threat to your organization?
* What capabilities does the file have?
* How can I detect this malware/file on other systems acress the organization?
* What does the file reveal about its creator/your adversary?
  * Malware is just a tool that is being used by someone else, there is always a human being behind it and, more importantly, a goal.

## Methods of Analysis
1. Fully-Automated Analysis (running file through virus scanner/analyzer)
2. Static properties analysis (manually analyzing file using [PeStudio](https://www.winitor.com/))
3. Interactive behavior analysis: (executing the file in a VM made to do so)
4. Manual code review: (reading the file line by line in a text editor)

## Static Properties Analysis
1. What is the file's hashes? --> [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) & [Total Hash](https://totalhash.cymru.com/)
2. What is the packer identifier? --> Most programs on Windows are not self-sufficient and require the assistance of Windows .dll files. Most normal files need at least 5-8 .dll files, having less is considered a red flag. 
5. What are the embedded artifacts?
6. What is the file importing and exporting?
* Normal files usually have a very long list of functions that the program declares it wants to use. Having none or very few is a red flag combined with the function VirtualAlloc.
* Accessing disk and cryptography would suggest that the file is ransomware.
* The function “VirtualAlloc” is often used by malware to extract the actual code, and it indicates the existence of packers.
  * Packers is short for “runtime packers” which are also known as “self-extracting archives”.

5. What human readable strings do you have?
  * Having no human readable strings in a file is unusual.

### Working towards these questions
* Is it malware?
* How bad is it?
* How do we detect it?

## Interactive Behavior Analysis
This type of analysis is used to examine how the file interacts with a test environment.

* Excute the file in an isolated lab system (sandbox) environment
* Observe what it interacts with, and how (file system, registry, network)
* Interact with the file to learn more about it
